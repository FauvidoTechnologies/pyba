# Memory

- A DSL to covert the action to a plain understanding summary for that action. This needs to be dynamic.
- We don't waste tokens and time here by giving it to an LLM, or store in any sort of a database unncessarily.

The current memory system is just holding the last turn in memory. We can make that better with this, a converted text in natural language based on what happened.
